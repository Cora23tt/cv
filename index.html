            <p>
                I graduated from Toshkent Axborot Texnologiyalari Universiteti (TATU), specializing in Software
                Engineering. My education provided me with strong foundational knowledge in IT and practical experience
                in software development, system design, and coding. TATU's focus on innovation and collaboration
                equipped me with skills that align well with modern technology trends and workplace needs.
